## Overview

For a while in starting my job as an IT Technician - my first significant interest was in the world on Networking and how everything on such as large fabric talks to each other and also talks to the wider internet - this led me to complete my CCST and introduce new subject areas of interest such as Cybersecurity. There was only one problem with doing my CCST, every switch management task I did was through Packet Tracer and not on a switch. While this isn't a bad thing the one thing I love is being able to get hands on with equipment and try every little thing I can with it. So when there was an unused switch that was due to be scrapped - I took the oppourtunity to ask if it was okay with me to wipe and use as a homelab - and my work said of course! So this is where this blog comes in...

In this blog, I want to look at the process and also the management of a switch by actually getting hands on with a <code>HP ProCurve Switch</code> and start to get to grips with some key commands for the HP hardware. Now obviously Cisco is the dominant force in Networking Equipment so maybe in the future I might have to invest in a small Cisco Switch to experience the management on one of those - but hey, this is a really good starting place. So without further ado - lets get started!
