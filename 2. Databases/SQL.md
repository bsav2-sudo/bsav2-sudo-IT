## Overview

While looking into Cybersecurity and developing my role as an IT Technician - one of the subjects that always keeps coming up is databases. They're the backbone of corporate environments for storing data from Usewrnames to Customer Databases. For me this is an area that I am very new to as I have not dealt with using databases until coming into my IT role where I now find myself surrounded by databases full of data that end users access on a daily basis in order to complete their tasks. From my look into cybersecurity - the one thing I always see is vulnerabilities in SQL servers such as easily-guessed passwords or the server version has been updated to support the latest patches.

So to get started in my journey at looking at databases - it only felt right that I started with SQL and learnt how to use SQL queries and commands to build a database as well as learning about some of the features of mySQL. Without further ado - time to get this started.
