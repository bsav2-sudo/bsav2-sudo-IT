## Overview

While looking into Cybersecurity and developing my role as an IT Technician - one of the subjects that always keeps coming up is Databases. They're the backbone of corporate environments for storing data from Usernames to Customer Databases. For me this is an area that I am very new to as I have not dealt with using databases until coming into my IT role where I now find myself surrounded by databases full of data that end users access on a daily basis in order to complete their tasks. From my look into cybersecurity - the one thing I always see is vulnerabilities in SQL servers such as easily-guessed passwords or the server version has been updated to support the latest patches.

So to get started in my journey at looking at databases - it only felt right that I started with SQL and learnt how to use SQL queries and commands to build a database as well as learning about some of the features of mySQL. Without further ado - time to get this started.

## Downloading mySQL 

I chose to go with mySQL for this project as when researching SQL databases that I could use I found it to be the most reliable SQL database and is also open-source which is always something I like. So I got started by heading to the mySQL website ([mySQL Homepage](https://www.mysql.com/)) and downloading the latest mySQL Community Version. Once downloaded and installed I can set what I want to install - in this case I went for everything including the mySQL Workbench and the mySQL Command Line Client - just so I can get a feel for how both interfaces work with SQL.

And now I have it installed and of course setting a password...

Tah Dah! Successfully got mySQL running and as you can see I decided to go for a Command Line Interface - can never beat a good CLI. If I run the <code>status</code> command in the CLI - this will show me the status of the SQL server and whether the CLI Client is connected to the server or not.

Cool we are connected to the server - I'm also going to run one more command to check that everything is how I expect it to be in this install - <code>show databases;</code> does what it says on the tin and lets me look at the databases that are on the server - should only see 4 as I haven't done anything yet.

Wahey all sorted! This is where I'll end it today but tomorrow I'll look at the basic commands in SQL to get a good starting basis.
